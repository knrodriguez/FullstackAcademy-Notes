## Reflections
1. What has it taken you to get here?
    I took a independent study course for C++ in college; however it ended after one semester
    as I was accepting an internship for my degree (in Electrical Engineering). I got a job at an energy consulting company, and had fun making useful trackers/tools using Google Sheets. After I left that position, I practiced random coding courses and create VBA tools for friends. I then decided to try and make this hobby a career, and I accepted a spot at an immersive for Per Scholas. I then got sick after graduation this year, and it knocked me out for months. I was too scared years ago to apply to Fullstack Academy's WDF program, as I didn't think I had enough skills. After completing the Per Scholas immersive, I felt confident to apply to Fullstack. I am so glad that I did. It's been a long road to get here, but I am immensely grateful to be here. 
2. Why are you doing this?
    I am feeling better, and I want to get back into the programming groove, and realize a career that is not just work, but a passion and is as enjoyable as work can be.  
3. What do you anticipate challenging you during your time here?
    I fear that I will struggle to understand new concepts in a timely manner, as I know this program goes deep into a wide array of topics.  
4. What do you want to tell your future self?
    Fail, fail, fail, and get back up each and every time just to fail some more. That way when you succeed, it will have been worth it.
5. What are you most nervous about?
    Bathroom breaks, and I am super awkward on video chat. Also, the fast-learning that I will need to do.
6. What would you like to achieve over the next 17 weeks?
    I would like to complete at least 3 projects of substantial worth to companies looking to hire me. I would like to develop my portfolio and display it in both a comprehensive and attractive way. I would also like to help other students as much as I can, both to help them and myself get a full grasp of the concepts we are learning. I would also like to be helped by other students, fellows, and instructors, so I can learn different viewpoints and strategies to complete a project.
